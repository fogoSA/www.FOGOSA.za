<p><b><h2>The Forgotten Nation of South Africa (FogoSA) is a non-profit organisation, established in February 2021 and registered with the Department of Social Development in April 2021. Its main goal is to address the government policy of ageism, which discriminates against persons over 35 years of age and older when it comes to job opportunities and employment in labour market. Our aim is to specifically ensure that every unemployed person older than 35 years receives the social, psychological and material support required to fulfil his/her potential.</b></h2></p>

<p><b><h2>Over the years, the nature of our society has changed such that the over 35 years’ age group have been displaced from a position of high status, commanding respect, power, and deference. We are now degraded, depressed and desperate because of the wrongful and unjustifiable adverse discrimination we face on the grounds of age.  Ageism in recruitment processes is based on and perpetuated stereotyping and discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of their age. This has resulted in a permanent systematic problem in our country, leaving millions in a dire situation:  countless unemployed people of working age, jobless, able and available to work, and actively looking for a job.</b></h2></p>

<center><h1><b>Our approach and Strategy</h1></b></center>

<p><b><h2>To create meaningful change, we must work with over 35 years and older people, members and other organisations, and forge new strategic alliances, collaborating across communities and sectors.</b></h2></p>

<P><b><h2>The Forgotten Nation of South Africa and our work with others, will be central to this strategy in the decade ahead. This diverse network – which will include all stakeholders and organisations across the country will be united in creating a fairer world for over 35 years and older people. Together, we will improved the lives of millions of 35 years and older people across the country. Over the next decade, we will grow and strengthen the organisation and our work with partners, inspiring a broader movement for change which will put population and individual ageing at the heart of development and transform the lives of over 35 years and older people. To do this we will bring older people, partners, governments, researchers, civil society and others together at a local, national and level. We have listened to over 35 years and older people, Social media and network members and partners and thought carefully about our role and how we can prioritise our efforts to achieve the biggest impact. We have also reflected on the changing environment for international aid and development and how we can achieve the impact we want to see, which is multi-sectoral, systemic and can only be delivered by a wide range of actors working together across boundaries.</p></h2></b>

<p><b><h2>We have built this strategy around wellbeing, dignity and voice. These are the components to achieving a better quality of life for over 35 years and older people. Wellbeing, dignity and voice will be integrated across all our work so everything we do is grounded in whatever 35years and older people say is important to them. Ensuring over 35 years and older people have a good quality of life means going beyond meeting their basic needs. Over 35 years and older people must also be able to make their own decisions and have access to high quality, accessible services and resources which support their dignity and independence, and uphold their rights. Bringing these three components together in our strategy means that we balance an understanding of the material aspects of a good quality of life with other things that over 35 years and older people tell us are important, such as self-worth and value, and participation. 
These components also challenge us to address deeprooted power imbalances, listen to the voices of the most marginalised, and support all over 35 years and older people to be heard.</b></h2></p>
