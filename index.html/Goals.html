<p><b><h2>We want every older person, everywhere, to be able to say: “I enjoy wellbeing”
We have a sense of wellbeing when we are able to lead fulfilling lives with purpose and meaning to them. Our wellbeing is influenced by our own outlook, characteristics and circumstances, our connections to the world around us, and the social, cultural, economic and political systems we are part of.</p></h2></b>

<center><h1><b>Dignity</center></h1></b>
 
<p><b><h2>We want every older person, everywhere, to be able to say: “I am treated with dignity “Dignity is central to wellbeing. It is our inherent value because we are human. We feel it in a sense of our own self-worth and in other people’s respect for us. Human rights instruments set out the minimum standards necessary for everyone to live a life of dignity. We are all born free and equal in dignity and human rights and this does not change as we age. We want to live in a world where over 35 years and older people are recognised and respected as individuals, have a strong sense of belonging, purpose and self-worth and can cope with the changes life presents. We’re striving for a world where dignity is understood – not as doing things for, or to, older over 35 years people in their best interests – but as older people determining their own lives and making their own decisions, with support if necessary, based on what is important to them. When laws, policies, services and our individual relationships all foster this sense of dignity, we can flourish and thrive.</b></h2></p>
 
<center><h1><b>Voice</h1></b></center>
 
<p><b><h2>We want every over 35 years and older person, everywhere, to be able to say: “My voice is heard “Voice is about over 35 years and older people’s ability to claim their rights, to make choices and to participate meaningfully in decision-making in all parts of life, including the personal, family, social and political. We want to support older people to exercise their right to speak as they wish and have their voices heard and their issues included in laws, policies, programmes and services. To do this, we must understand the contextual factors that can act as a barrier to older people’s voices and better understand the power relations at work.</b></h2></p>

<center><h1><b>Our promise</h1></b></center>
 
<p><b><h2>We will be talking to hundreds of individuals, including over 35 years and older people, staff, partners, network members, policymakers and other stakeholders from around the world to inform this strategy. These consultations gave us a sense of the struggle to survive for the majority of over 35 years and older people we spoke to, and the barriers they are faced with. What also emerged is the resilience and experience of over 35 years and older people, which is often overlooked by governments and civil society when they are designing policies and programmes. Over 35 years and older people told us that they want the opportunity to contribute and to feel connected. To be independent, treated with dignity and respect, and to participate equally in society. They want a secure income, access to quality health services and good care and support. What unites us all is the belief that over 35 years and older people should enjoy the same rights as everyone else and an improved quality of life. Our promise is that: By 2030, millions of over 35 years and older people will enjoy a better quality of life, through improved wellbeing, enhanced dignity and greater voice.</b></h2></p>
