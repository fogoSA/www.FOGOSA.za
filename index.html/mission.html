<p><h3>We demand the establishment of a Labour Desk which must be legislated will act as our point of reference and document all South African citizens above the age of 35 years with their skills and qualifications. This will assist the government to easier identify individuals for employment purposes.</h3></p>

 <h2><b>The purpose of the creation of the Labour Desk is:</h2></b>
 
<p><h3>•To create a caring, protective and enabling environment for addressing issues of unemployed people of over 35 years of age. These issues will include employment references as most members of this age group no longer have references, due to having been long idle.
